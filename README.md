# Malware-Analysis

This is a project of the Dependability course of the master's degree program in Cybersecurity in Pisa.
In the project we were asked to analyze a list of malware provided to us. The complete malware analysis can be found in the Android Malware Analysis file.
The following tools were used for malware analysis: 

## VirusTotal 
**VirusTotal** is a website that allows free analysis of files and/or URLs to detect the 
presence of viruses or malware hidden within. It uses more than 70 antivirus software 
including Kaspersky, Avira, BitDefender, AVG and McAfee.

## MobSF 
**Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)** is a security research platform for mobile 
applications running on Android, iOS and Windows Mobile. MobSF has several areas of 
application such as mobile application security, penetration testing, malware analysis 
and privacy analysis. The static analyser supports popular mobile application binaries 
such as APK, IPA, APPX, and source code. The dynamic analyser, on the other hand, 
supports Android and iOS applications and offers a platform for interactive 
instrumented testing, runtime data analysis and network traffic analysis. 

## Genymotion 
Genymotion is a free Android emulator for Windows. it was used to perform dynamic 
analysis: genymotion emulates the android device on which the malicious application 
will run to be analysed by MobSF.
